- Next placed individual content in each column, followed by styling them.
- Created a button with hover effect.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### Continued development

Still learning how to apply Bootstrap and understanding it better.
